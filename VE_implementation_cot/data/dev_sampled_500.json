death\u2014equivalent to $ billion as of \u2014while his drug cartel monopolized the cocaine trade into the United States in the 1980s and 1990s.","Born in Rionegro and raised in Medell\u00edn, Escobar studied briefly at Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Latinoamericana of Medell\u00edn, but left without graduating; he instead began engaging in criminal activity, selling illegal cigarettes and fake lottery tickets, as well as participating in motor vehicle theft.","In the early 1970s, he began to work for various drug smugglers, often kidnapping and holding people for ransom.","In 1976, Escobar founded the Medell\u00edn Cartel, which distributed powder cocaine, and established the first smuggling routes into the United States.","Escobar's infiltration into the U.S. created exponential demand for cocaine, and by the 1980s, it was estimated Escobar led monthly shipments of 70 to 80 tons of cocaine into the country from Colombia.","As a result, Escobar quickly became one of the richest people in the world, but consistently battled rival cartels domestically and abroad, leading to massacres and the murders of police officers, judges, locals, and prominent politicians, making Colombia the murder capital of the world.","In the 1982 parliamentary election, Escobar was elected as an alternate member of the Chamber of Representatives as part of the Liberal Alternative movement.","Through this, he was responsible for community projects, such as the construction of houses and football fields, which gained him popularity among the locals of the towns that he frequented.","However, Escobar was vilified by the Colombian and U.S. governments, who routinely stifled his political ambitions and pushed for his arrest, with Escobar widely believed to have orchestrated the DAS Building bombing and Avianca Flight 203 bombings in retaliation.","In 1991, Escobar surrendered to authorities, and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on a host of charges, but struck a deal of no extradition with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, with the ability of being housed in his own, self-built prison, La Catedral.","In 1992, Escobar escaped and went into hiding when authorities attempted to move him to a more standard holding facility, leading to a nation-wide manhunt.","As a result, the Medell\u00edn Cartel crumbled, and in 1993, Escobar was killed in his hometown by Colombian National Police, a day after his 44th birthday.","His legacy remains controversial; while many denounce the heinous nature of his crimes, Escobar was seen as a \"Robin

born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth.","In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.","Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents.","For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947.","This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth.","The location of the maternity ward or other

one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent.","In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of

all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\").","There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise.","The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the
